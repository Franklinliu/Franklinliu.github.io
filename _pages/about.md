I am a Ph.D. candidate from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU, Singapore). 
I got my bachelor's from Northeastern University in 2016 and master's degree from Beihang Univeristy in 2019, under the supervision of [Prof Jiang Bo](http://jiangbo.buaa.edu.cn/).
I joined Cyber Security Lab as a research assistant in March 2019 and later pursue the Ph.D degree in August.
I am supervised [Prof. Li Yi](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yi_li/). 
My research interest mainly lies on smart contract analyis, formal verification, software testing, and specification mining.
