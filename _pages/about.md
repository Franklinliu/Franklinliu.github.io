I am currently a research scientist, supervised by [Prof. David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/) from Singapore Management University (SMU, Singapore). Before joining SMU, I was a research fellow at NTU. I received my Ph.D. in 2023 from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU, Singapore), supervised by [Prof. Li Yi](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yi_li/) and [Prof. Liu Yang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/) (co-supervisor). 
I received my M.Sc. in 2019 from Beihang Univeristy (BUAA, China), under the supervision of [Prof Jiang Bo](http://jiangbo.buaa.edu.cn/).
My research interest includes but not limited to smart contract security and reliability, formal verification, and program analysis.
