I am a Ph.D. candidate from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU, Singapore). 
I got my bachelor's degree from Northeastern University and master's degree from Beihang Univeristy, under the supervision of [Prof Jiang Bo](http://jiangbo.buaa.edu.cn/).
I pursue the Ph.D degree since August 2019 and am supervised by [Prof. Li Yi](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yi_li/). 
My research interest mainly lies on smart contract analysis, formal verification, software testing, and specification mining.
