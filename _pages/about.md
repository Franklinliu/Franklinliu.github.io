I am now a research scientist, supervised by <a href="http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/">Prof. David Lo</a> from Singapore Management University (SMU, Singapore). Before joining SMU, I was a research fellow at NTU. I received my Ph.D. in 2023 from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU, Singapore), supervised by <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yi_li/">Prof. Li Yi</a> and <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/">Prof. Liu Yang</a> (co-supervisor). 
I received my M.Sc. in 2019 from Beihang Univeristy (BUAA, China), under the supervision of <a href="http://jiangbo.buaa.edu.cn/">Prof Jiang Bo</a>.
My research interest includes but not limited to smart contract security and reliability, formal verification, and program analysis.
